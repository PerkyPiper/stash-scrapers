# Piper's Scrapers
These are some of the scrapers that I made for [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash)!

They are a **work in progress**, and subject to change!!!

## Install
1. In Stash go to **Settings**>**Metadata Providers**>**Available Scrapers**
2. Click **Add Source**
3. For **Source URL** put: `https://perkypiper.github.io/stash-scrapers/main/index.yml`
4. For the other fields put `PerkyPiper` (or whatever you want)
5. Select the scrapers you want and click **Install**!

NOTE: Most of my scrapers require the `py_common` scraper under the "Community" source!
